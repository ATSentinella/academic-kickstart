I am interested in the relationships between genetics and ecology, especially  in how we can use both to understand the effect of climate change. My first project is on the broad scale latitudinal gradient of climate risk on germination, and my next project with the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney will focus on detecting landscape genetics patterns. I’m also passionate about science communication, project managing scientific displays for UNSW and co-presenting a weekly science program on community radio (“Boiling Point” on Eastside FM).
